# Lending Club Case Study

## Business Understanding:

We collaborate with a consumer finance organization that specializes in financing various forms of loans to urban clients. The corporation gets loan applications and must choose whether to approve them based on the applicant profiles. The company's decision-making process carries two major risks:

Business Risk: Denying a loan to a potentially creditworthy applicant results in a loss of business for the company.
Default Risk: If an applicant is likely to default on the loan, accepting the loan may result in financial losses for the firm.

## Business Objectives:

1)The organization hopes to find patterns and indications that indicate loan default based on customer and loan characteristics.

2)Understanding these tendencies attempts to improve loan approval decisions.

3)Deny loans, modify loan amounts, or provide higher interest rates to hazardous applicants.

4)Reduce credit losses incurred by failing borrowers.

## Key Information:

1)The dataset provides information on previous loan applicants, including whether they defaulted or not.

2)The organization plans to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify factors impacting loan default rates.

3)Identifying high-risk loan applicants can assist to optimize the lending portfolio and improve risk assessment methods.


## Conclusion:

1)Home Loan Applicants: Applicants with existing home loans have lower chances of loan defaults.

2)Small Business Loans: Applicants seeking loans for small businesses have a higher likelihood of loan defaults.

3)Default Trends by Year:
The year 2007 witnessed the highest number of loan defaults.
Conversely, 2009 experienced the lowest number of loan defaults.

4)Default Trends by Month:
Loans issued in May, September, and December showed a higher number of defaults.
February had a notable increase in loan defaults.

5)Loan Approval Period:
Applicants whose loans were approved between September and December contributed to the majority of loan def

This extensive case study digs into the world of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), with a focus on identifying the critical characteristics required to forecast loan default likelihood. We reveal the critical aspects required for making educated loan approval choices through a visually appealing presentation, which is supported by meaningful data distributions.
